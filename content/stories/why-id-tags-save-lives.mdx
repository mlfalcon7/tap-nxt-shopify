During deployments with search-and-rescue teams we repeatedly witness the same thing: heroes who make it home had identification that survived the chaos. Microchips are essential, but nothing beats human-readable data. TAP tags use deep-engraved steel that withstands smoke, seawater, and abrasion from rubble.

Equip every hero with:

- Primary ID tag with handler contact and vet info.
- Mission patch that signals medical alerts.
- Backup QR code tag tied to your TAP account.

Pair this with the Pet Safety Pledge and your hero is never anonymous.
