Submit your hero to the Hall and the ripple effect begins. Families seeing their dog on tap.mission feel seen—and rescues gain donors overnight. When you upload photos and mission reports, we pair them with TAP grants so that every share funds medical bills, transport flights, or vest certification.

Here is how to craft a powerful submission:

1. Start with the moment your hero earned their title.
2. Describe the gear or training that assisted the mission.
3. Close with a call to action—adopt, foster, donate, or sign the Pet Safety Pledge.

Your story fuels our campaigns. Never underestimate the power of hero narratives.
