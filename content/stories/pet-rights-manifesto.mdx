The Pet Rights Manifesto is not marketing—it is the codex we operate from. Every collar we stitch, every vest we weld, and every story we platform must reinforce these immutable rights:

1. **Right to Secure Identification** — No dog should re-enter a shelter without a fast path home.
2. **Right to Protected Adventure** — Gear must enable missions, not limit them.
3. **Right to Recognition** — Dogs are heroes. Language and product experience must reflect it.

When you sign the Pet Safety Pledge or deploy TAP gear, you become part of this doctrine. Keep it pinned to your fridge. Share it with your local rescue. Let the world know the standard has changed.
