# The Partner on the Night Shift

A K9 officer and their handler work the night shift. When seconds count, gear can't fail.

## The Mission

This K9 hero has been on hundreds of deployments, tracked countless suspects, and saved lives. The gear they wear isn't just equipment—it's mission-critical infrastructure.

## The Gear / The Lesson

K9 units need gear that's mission-grade and field-tested. TAP gear is built to the same standards that working K9 units demand. But the same principles—durability, safety, reliability—apply to every dog, whether they're on patrol or in the backyard.

**TAP is for K9 units, but it's also for everyday dogs.** The same gear that keeps working dogs safe can keep your family dog safe too.
