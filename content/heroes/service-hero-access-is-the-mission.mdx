# Access is the Mission

A service dog and their handler navigate the world together. Access isn't a privilege—it's a right.

## The Mission

Clear identification, reliable gear, and handler-first design make the difference between a smooth day and a confrontation. This service hero proves that when gear is built right, the mission becomes possible.

## The Gear / The Lesson

Service dogs need gear that's clear, reliable, and handler-first. TAP gear is designed to make access easier, not harder. Clear ID, protocol-tested safety, and handler-focused design—because access is the mission.

But TAP isn't just for service dogs. The same principles—clear identification, reliable gear, handler-first design—apply to every dog and their family.
