# The Dog Who Watched Over the Block

This is a story about an everyday family dog. No special training. No official designation. Just a dog who became a neighborhood hero.

## The Mission

Every morning, rain or shine, this family dog walked the neighborhood with their owner. Not a service dog, not a working K9—just a loyal companion who became a familiar, trusted presence. When a neighbor's child wandered too far, this everyday hero led them home. No vest, no badge—just a dog doing what dogs do: watching over their pack.

## The Gear / The Lesson

Every dog deserves clear identification. A simple ID tag on a reliable collar can mean the difference between a quick return home and hours of worry. TAP gear isn't just for working dogs—it's for every dog who might need to be found, recognized, or trusted.

**TAP is for everyday dogs, not just working dogs.** Whether your dog is a family companion, a rescue, or a working hero, they deserve gear that's built to last and designed to keep them safe.
