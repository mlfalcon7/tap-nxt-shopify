# War Dogs and the Missions They Ran

During World War II, thousands of dogs served alongside American forces. They carried messages, detected mines, guarded perimeters, and saved countless lives.

## The Mission

These dogs weren't just tools—they were partners. Their missions were real, their risks were real, and their impact was immeasurable. From the beaches of Normandy to the jungles of the Pacific, war dogs proved that when the stakes are high, you need gear that won't fail.

## The Gear / The Lesson

The lessons from WWII war dogs still apply today: identification matters, reliability saves lives, and every working dog deserves gear that won't fail under pressure. Modern K9 units and service dogs carry on this legacy—and TAP gear is built to honor it.

But TAP isn't just for working dogs. The same principles—durability, identification, reliability—apply to every dog, whether they're on a battlefield or in a backyard.
